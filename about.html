                <p>I am an ambitious student pursuing a BS in Software Engineering at COMSATS University Islamabad,
                    Lahore Campus. Passionate about web development, I possess strong skills in HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. Recently, I've gained proficiency in Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Proven capacity
                    to quickly pick up and use new technologies, along with a keen interest in system programming with C
                    and Java, and problem-solving. I actively participate in projects, aiming to apply my knowledge and
                    drive in real-world scenarios.
                    <br>
                    I am excited to connect with industry professionals and fellow tech enthusiasts to learn, share, and
                    contribute to the future of software engineering. Letâ€™s connect!
                    <br>
                    My journey so far has been marked by a strong commitment to continuous learning and improvement. I
                    thrive on challenges and am always looking for opportunities to apply my skills in innovative and
                    impactful ways. I have worked on various projects, from developing full-stack applications to
                    contributing to open-source initiatives. Each experience has broadened my perspective and honed my
                    abilities, driving me to strive for excellence in every endeavor.
                    <br>
                    I believe in the power of collaboration and am eager to engage with others who share my passion for
                    technology. Together, we can explore new ideas, tackle complex problems, and create solutions that
                    make a difference. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring how we can work together to
